## Project for Jigsaw Labs fall/spring 2020â€“2021

Read data from an [open source API provided by the state of Texas](https://data.texas.gov/resource/naix-2893.json) which shows liqour sales per venue/merchant. Sales are broken down by beer, wine, liquor, cover charges. Overlay this on a map of Texas. 

ZIPs and Cities are provided [here](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/tx/#zips-list), but requires a bit of hand massaging because of multiple cities being on same lines of csv. Additional per-zip information available [here](https://www.zip-codes.com/zip-code-api-register.asp).

#### Tech used: 
- Python 
- Flask
- Streamlit

#### Stretch goals

Hope to eventually overlay one or more data streams from CDC, many of which are indexed by ZIP.
